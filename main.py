# Practice with classes!

# We are going to create some vehicles using classes

# First, create a class for a car

# I'll give you some helper code below, but less and less of it will be present as we go through more vehicles


class Car:
  def __init__(self, maker, year, type):
    # maker = manufacturer
    # year = year of manufacturing
    # type = type of vehicle (sedan, truck, suv, etc)
    self.maker = maker
    self.year = ...
    ...

  # Lets pretend this car brand got bought out by another
  # Now, make a function to represent this by changing the name of the maker
  def maker_change(self, new_maker):
    self.maker = ...


# Now, create another class for a motorcycle

class Motorcycle:

  # Add the following attributes to this motorcycle
  # maker
  # year
  # color
  # miles_driven
  def __init__(self, ...):
    ...

  # Now, pretend you took this motorcycle on a road trip
  # Create a function to add 500 miles to the miles variable!
  def road_trip(self):
    ...


# Now create a class for a plane

# This plane should have a:
#   maker
#   airline
#   year
#   miles_flown
#   seat_capacity
#   is_luxury (boolean)

# Go ahead and create this class!


# Your airline wants to add less seating in the plane so that the passengers have more legroom!
# Create a function to update the seat_capacity variable to have less seats (of your own choosing)

# It has been another year since the manufacturing date
# Go ahead and create another function to add one to the year variable!

# Now we have all of our classes!
# Go ahead and make some examples of the classes

volvo = Car('Volvo', 2015, 'Sedan')
...

# Now that we have these examples, I want you to create ...
